# 4Wallpaper_Over24

this is a live background theme, there are 4 times the same background, but at different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening and night), it changes every 6 hours with a quarter of an hour fade between each.

The screen backgrounds are from Matt Vince (https://www.mattvince.com/)

Only tested on Gnome, will try on other ED soon
